## PROPOSAL WORK

## Research Question

This research seeks to quantify the relationship between international migration and economic performance, controlling for key macroeconomic indicators. Understanding this relationship is relevant as OECD nations face labor shortages, demographic shifts, and policy debates about the economic consequences of immigration. Therefore, we investigate the following question: **How do immigration increases impact GDP per capita across OECD countries, and over what time period do these effects occur?**

## Data

In this project, the primary data sources are as follows:

* **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) International Migration Database** found [here][https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/oecd-databases-on-migration.html], which shows immigration in and outflows and net migration)

* **OECD GDP and Non-Financial Accounts** found [here][https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/gdp-and-non-financial-accounts.html], shows GDP per capita and macro controls for countries.

I will use country–year pairs for OECD members (target: 2000–2022) for **Observational units**, and the **key variables** will be as follows:

* **Response variable:** GDP per capita (in constant 2020 PPP-adjusted dollars). I will also analyze the natural logarithm of GDP per capita, $\log(\text{GDPpc})$, which allows us to interpret results in terms of *elasticities*—that is, approximate percentage changes in GDP per capita for a one-unit change in the predictor.  
* **Main predictors:** immigration inflow rate (per 1,000 population) at years $t$, $t-1$, and $t-2$, to capture both immediate and delayed effects.  
* **Controls** $(\mathbf{X}_{it})$: unemployment rate, investment rate (gross fixed capital formation as % of GDP), tertiary education attainment, labor force participation rate, population growth, consumer price inflation, and government consumption as % of GDP.

## Model

To analyze the relationship between immigration and GDP, I will estimate a **panel regression model with country and year fixed effects**.  

A *panel dataset* combines both cross-sectional (across countries) and time-series (across years) variation. The model can be written as:

$$
\log(\text{GDPpc}_{it}) =
\beta_0 +
\sum_{k=0}^{2} \beta_k \text{ImmigrationRate}_{i,t-k} +
\mathbf{X}'_{it}\boldsymbol{\gamma} +
\alpha_i + \delta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

where:
* $i$ indexes countries and $t$ indexes years,  
* $\alpha_i$ are **country fixed effects (FE)**, which control for all unobserved, time-invariant characteristics of each country (such as geography, institutions, or cultural norms),  
* $\delta_t$ are **year fixed effects**, which control for global events that affect all countries in a given year (for example, recessions, oil price shocks, or COVID-19),  
* $\varepsilon_{it}$ is the error term. 

This “two-way fixed effects” approach isolates **within-country changes over time**, rather than differences between countries, improving causal interpretation.  

Taking the logarithm of GDP per capita stabilizes variance (reduces *heteroskedasticity*) and allows the coefficients $(\beta)$ to be interpreted as approximate percentage changes in GDP per capita.

## Proposed Extension (Beyond Simple Linear Regression)

1.  **Distributed Lag Specification:** Include 0–2 year lags of immigration inflows to capture delayed macro effects; compute the **long-run cumulative effect** $\sum_{k=0}\^2 \beta_k$ with standard errors (delta method).\
2.  **Two-Way Fixed Effects:** Control for unobserved country traits and global shocks.\
3.  **Model Comparison:** OLS vs. FE; FE with (p=0) vs. FE with (p=2) lags; selection via AIC/BIC and out-of-sample fit.\
4.  **Robustness check if possible:**
    * Add a **lagged dependent variable** and note the bias it induces\
    * Clustered standard errors at the country level; test serial correlation in panels.

## Analysis Plan

1. **Estimation and Inference**  
   - Fit multiple FE models with different lag structures and report coefficient estimates (\(\beta_k\)).  
   - Plot **impulse profiles** showing how immigration affects GDP per capita over subsequent years.  
   - Check for **multicollinearity** among predictors using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  
   - Use residual plots and heteroskedasticity tests to assess model assumptions.

2. **Hypothesis Tests**
   - **Short-run effect:** \(H_0: \beta_0 = 0\) vs. \(H_A: \beta_0 \neq 0\).  
   - **Lagged effects:** \(H_0: \beta_1=\beta_2=0\) (joint Wald test).  
   - **Cumulative long-run effect:** \(H_0: \beta_0+\beta_1+\beta_2=0\) (linear hypothesis test with clustered standard errors).

3. **Model Validation and Fit**
   - Compare models using AIC and BIC values to balance model complexity and fit.  
   - Evaluate predictive accuracy using **blocked k-fold cross-validation**, which divides the data by countries (to preserve the panel structure).  
   - Compute **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**—metrics that summarize how far predicted values deviate from actual GDP per capita. Lower RMSE and MAE indicate better model fit.

4. **Interpretation of Results**
   - Report coefficients as elasticities: for example, a coefficient of 0.02 on immigration rate means that a one-unit increase in immigration rate (per 1,000 people) is associated with a 2% increase in GDP per capita, holding other factors constant.  
   - Discuss the timing of effects: whether impacts appear immediately, after one year, or over multiple years.


I plan to share the following **deliverables** in this project:

* Regression tables with coefficients and confidence intervals  
* A figure showing the time path of immigration’s estimated impact  
* Model comparison table (AIC, BIC, RMSE, MAE) 

Finally, I plan to use the following **software:** R for model estimation and validation; Python (`pandas`, `numpy`) may be used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
